# This code explains the tuple datatype in python
# Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists, i.e. once
# they are declared they cant be changed, hence
# they dont have any methods.

tuple1 = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )

# To declare a singleton tuple, we need to add a comma
# at the end
singleton = 'hello',
